Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on bike-share data


## Introduction

This repository is part of my portfolio, showing an example of EDA.
The project originated from the Case study of the *Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate* I completed in October 2023.



## Data Source

Data are available online from https://divvybikes-marketing-staging.lyft.net/system-data
They are public data, updated monthly, by the Chicago bike-share compagny (https://divvybikes.com/) with a user license agreement (https://divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement).

These data can also be retrieved from Chicago data portal (https://data.cityofchicago.org/Transportation/Divvy-Trips/fg6s-gzvg) with additional information related to the trips and users.

I based my analysis on a 12-month period, from August 2022 to July 2023 (12 files).



## Tools used for analysis

Dealing with heavy data, I decided to import data into **Google BigQuery** (free *Sandbox* account).

For this EDA, I used **SQL** from BigQuery to perform data cleaning and treatment, and **Google Sheets** for data analysis and visualisation.
